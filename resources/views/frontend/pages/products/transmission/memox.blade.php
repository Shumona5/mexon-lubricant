        <h1>Application EN</h1>
        <p>Memox Gear oil 140 GL-5 is primarily used in heavy-duty automotive applications, such as in the differentials of trucks, buses, and other vehicles using hypoid gears. It is also suitable for some manual transmissions, transfer cases, and industrial gear systems that require a high viscosity oil with GL-5 performance.</p>

        <h1>Key Features:</h1>
        <p>
            Exceptional Protection: Memox contains elegant substances that give superior protection against wear, corrosion, and oxidation. Its increased film strength reduces metal-to-metal contact, resulting in less friction and heat generation even under the most intense conditions.
            <br>
            Enhanced Performance: Memox gear oil is designed for heavy-duty applications and has good thermal stability, preserving viscosity and lubricating qualities across a wide temperature range. This assures consistent performance and reliability, even in difficult situations.
            <br>
            Extended Service Life: Memox allows you to extend the service life of your equipment and save maintenance expenditures. Its tough formulation resists breakdown and degradation, prolonging the time between oil changes and equipment overhauls.
            <br>
            Compatibility: Memox can be used with a variety of components that are frequently found in gear systems, including as gaskets, seals, and ferrous and non-ferrous metals. This guarantees interoperability with current machinery and promotes a smooth incorporation into your maintenance schedule.
